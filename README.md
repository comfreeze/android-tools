# android-tools

This is a library compiled from various classes written across a variety of 
Android projects.  Several of the contained classes are products of trial-
and-error and multiple trips to https://stackoverflow.com but they may be 
outdated quickly, as Android adopts best practices and evolves quickly.

The library itself is distributed as an AAR package, but pull requests for
contributions are appreciated.
